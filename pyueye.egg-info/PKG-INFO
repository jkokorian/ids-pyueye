        Description
        -----------
        PyuEye is a lean wrapper implementation of Python function objects that represent uEye API functions. As there is no intelligence in the PyuEye interface, it is as near as possible to the uEye C API and always up-to-date. Benefit from many Python advantages, for example the interactive programming of your uEye camera. Write and test small code snippets without the complex setup of a programming IDE with a toolchain. The PyuEye interface is ideal for prototyping uEye camera applications for all supported uEye platforms (Windows, Linux, Linux Embedded).
        
        You find more information on this software version in the PyuEye `release notes <https://en.ids-imaging.com/pyueye-release-notes>`_.
